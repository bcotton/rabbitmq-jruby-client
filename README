This project is a JRuby wrapper of the Java RabbitMQ Client from Rabbit Technologies

http://www.rabbitmq.com/

Using this library does not require you to use EventMachine for subscribing a RabbitMQ queue.

To use RabbitMQ JRuby Client with Workling:
1. Copy workling_rabbitmq_client.rb and workling_rabbitmq_subscriber.rb to lib
Create an initializer 'rabbitmq.rb' in 'config/initializers'

require 'workling_rabbitmq_client'
Workling::Remote.dispatcher = Workling::Remote::Runners::ClientRunner.new
Workling::Remote.dispatcher.client = Workling::Clients::WorklingRabbitMQClient.new

Optional: To use subscriber
Modify vendor/plugins/workling/script/listen.rb, added this after the require statements

require 'workling_rabbitmq_subscriber'

To start Workling: (You can use script/workling_client because it uses daemons)
jruby vendor/plugins/workling/script/listen.rb
